<h2 class="OraPortletHeader">Documentation Accessibility</h2>
<p class="text">Our goal is to make Oracle products, services, and supporting documentation accessible,
with good usability, to the disabled community. To that end, our documentation includes
features that make information available to users of assistive technology. This documentation
is available in HTML format, and contains markup to facilitate access by the disabled community.
Standards will continue to evolve over time, and Oracle is actively engaged with
other market-leading technology vendors to address technical obstacles so that our documentation
can be accessible to all of our customers. For additional information, visit the
Oracle Accessibility Program Web site at
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/accessibility/">http://www.oracle.com/accessibility/</a>.

<p class="text">This documentation may contain links to Web sites of other companies or organizations
that Oracle does not own or control. Oracle neither evaluates
nor makes any representations regarding the accessibility of these Web sites.
