<body>
<p>The image shows a computer named "Computer A" with Oracle Application Server installed on it. The text below Computer A reads: If Oracle Application Server is installed on this computer, Oracle Application Server components must run on this computer only.
</p>
<p>The image also shows additional computers. These computers do not have Oracle Application Server installed on them. The text below these computers reads: Although other computers can access Oracle Application Server files installed on Computer A, they should not run Oracle Application Server components from that installation. For a computer to run Oracle Application Server components, it must have its own Oracle Application Server installation.
